SAMPLE STORY #1
==================================================
In olden times the Spider Man lived in the skycountry. He dwelt in a bright little house all by himself, where he weaved webs and long flimsy ladders by which people went back and forth from the sky to the earth. The Starpeople often went at night to earth where they roamed about as fairies of light, doing good deeds for women and little children, and they always went back and forth on the ladder of the Spider Man. The Spider Man had to work very hard, weaving his webs, and spinning the yarn from which his ladders were made. One day when he had a short breathingtime from his toil he looked down at the earthcountry and there he saw many of the earthpeople playing at games, or taking sweet sap from the maple trees, or gathering berries on the rolling hills but most of the men were lazily idling and doing nothing. The women were all working, after the fashion of Indians in those days the men were working but little. And Spider Man said to himself, I should like to go to the earthcountry where men idle their time away. I would marry four wives who would work for me while I would take life easy, for I need a rest.He was very tired of his work for he was kept at it day and night always spinning and weaving his webs. But when he asked for a rest he was not allowed to stop he was only kicked for his pains and called Sleepy Head, and Lazybones and other harsh names, and told to work harder. Then he grew angry and he resolved to punish the Starpeople because they kept him so hard at work. He thought that if he punished them and made himself a nuisance, they would be glad to be rid of him. So he hit upon a crafty plan. Each night when a Starfairy was climbing back to the skycountry, just as he came near the top of the ladder, the Spider Man would cut the strands and the fairy would fall to earth with a great crash. Night after night he did this, and he chuckled to himself as he saw the skyfairies sprawling through the air and kicking their heels, while the earthpeople looked up wonderingly at them and called them Shooting Stars. Many Starpeople fell to earth in this way because of the Spider Mans tricks, and they could never get back to the skycountry because of their broken limbs or their disfigured faces, for in the skycountry the people all must have beautiful faces and forms. But Spider Mans tricks brought him no good the people would not drive him away because they needed his webs and he was kept always at his tasks. At last he decided to run away of his own accord, and, one night when the Moon and the Stars had gone to work and the Sun was asleep, he said farewell to the skycountry and let himself down to earth by one of his own strands of yarn, spinning it as he dropped down.In the earthcountry he married four wives as he had planned, for he wanted them to work for him while he took his ease. He thought he had worked long enough. All went well for a time and the Spider Man was quite happy living his lazy and contented life. Not a strand did he spin, nor a web did he weave. No men on earth were working only the women toiled. At last, Glooskap, who ruled upon the earth in that time, became very angry because the men in these parts were so lazy, and he sent Famine into their country to punish them for their sins. Famine came very stealthily into the land and gathered up all the corn and carried it off then he called to him all the animals, and the birds, and the fish of the sea and river, and he took them away with him. In all the land there was nothing left to eat. Only water remained. The people were very hungry and they lived on water for many days. Sometimes they drank the water cold, sometimes hot, sometimes lukewarm, but at best it was but poor fare. The Spider Man soon grew tired of this strange diet, for it did not satisfy his hunger to live always on water. It filled his belly and swelled him to a great size, but it brought him little nourishment or strength. So he said, There must be good food somewhere in the world I will go in search of it.That night when all the world was asleep he took a large bag, and crept softly away from his four wives and set out on his quest for food. He did not want any one to know where he was going. For several days he traveled, living only on water but he found no food, and the bag was still empty on his back. At last one day he saw birds in the trees and he knew that he was near the border of the HungerLand. That night in the forest when he stopped at a stream to drink, he saw a tiny gleam of light far ahead of him through the trees. He hurried towards the light and soon he came upon a man with a great hump on his shoulders and scars on his face, and a light hanging at his back, with a shade on it which he could close and open at his will.The Spider Man said, I am looking for food tell me where I can find it.And the humped man with the light said, Do you want it for your people?But the Spider Man said, No, I want it for myself.Then the humped man laughed and said, You are near to the border of the Land of Plenty follow me and I will give you food. Then he flashed the light at his back, opening and closing the shade so that the light flickered, and he set off quickly through the trees.The Spider Man followed the light flashing in the darkness, but he had to go so fast that he was almost out of breath when he reached the house where the humped man had stopped. But the humped man only laughed when he saw the Spider Man coming puffing wearily along with his fat and swollen belly. He gave him a good fat meal and the Spider Man soon felt better after his long fast.Then the humped man said, You are the Spider Man who once weaved webs in the sky. I, too, once dwelt in the starcountry, and one dark night as I was climbing back from the earthcountry on your ladder, carrying my lamp on my back to light the way, when I was near the sky you cut the strands of the web and I fell to the earth with a great crash. That is why I have a great hump on my back and scars on my face, and because of this I have never been allowed to go back to the skycountry of the stars. I roam the earth at nights as a forest fairy just as I did in the olden days, for I have my former power still with me, and I still carry my lamp at my back it is the starlight from the skycountry. I shall never get back to the starcountry while I have life. But some day when my work on earth is done I shall go back. But although you were cruel to me I will give you food. The Spider Man remembered the nights he had cut the ladder strands, and he laughed to himself at the memory of the starfairies falling to earth with a great crash. But the man with the light knew that now he had his chance to take vengeance on the Spider Man. The latter did not suspect evil. He was glad to get food at last.Then the humped man said, I will give you four pots. You must not open them until you get home. They will then be filled with food, and thereafter always when you open them they will be packed with good food. And the food will never grow less.The Spider Man put the four pots in his bag and slinging it over his shoulder he set out for his home, well pleased with his success. After he had gone away, the humped man used his power to make him hungry. Yet for several days he traveled without opening the pots, for although he was almost starving he wished to do as the humped man had told him. At last he could wait no longer. He stopped near his home, took the pots out of the bag and opened them. They were filled with good food as he had been promised. In one was a fine meat stew in another were many cooked vegetables in another was bread made from Indian corn and in another was luscious ripe fruit. He ate until he was full. He covered the pots, put them back in the bag, and hid the bag among the trees. Then he went home. He had meanwhile taken pity on his people and he decided to invite the Chief and all the tribe to a feast the next evening, for the pots would be full, and the food would never decrease, and there would be enough for all. He thought the people would regard him as a very wonderful man if he could supply them all with good food in their hunger.When he reached his home his wives were very glad to see him back, and they at once brought him water, the only food they had. But he laughed them to scorn, and threw the water in their faces and said, Oh, foolish women, I do not want water it is not food for a great man like me. I have had a good meal of meat stew and corn bread and cooked vegetables and luscious ripe fruit. I know where much food is to be found, but I alone know. I can find food when all others fail, for I am a great man. Go forth and invite the Chief and all the people to a feast which I shall provide for them tomorrow nighta feast for all the land, for my food never grows less. They were all amazed when they heard his story, and the thought of his good meal greatly added to their hunger. But they went out and summoned all the tribe to a feast as he had told them.The next night all the people gathered for the feast, for the news of it had spread through all the land. They had taken no water that day, for they wished to eat well, and they were very hungry. They were as hungry as wild beasts in search of food. The Spider Man was very glad because the people praised him, and he proudly brought in his bag of pots. The people all waited hungrily and eagerly. But when he uncovered the first pot there was no food there he uncovered the second pot, but there was no food there he uncovered all the pots, but not a bit of food was in any of them. They were all empty, and in the bottom of each was a great gaping hole. Now it had happened in this way.When the humped man, the Starfairy, had given the pots to the Spider Man, he knew well that the Spider Man would disobey his orders and that he would open the pots before he reached his home. He chuckled to himself, for he knew that now he could take vengeance on the webweaver who had injured him. So when the Spider Man had left the pots among the trees, the humped man used his magic power and made holes in the pots, and the charm of the food was broken and all the food disappeared. When the people saw the empty pots they thought they had been purposely deceived. The remains of the food and the smell of stew and of fruit still clung to the pots. They thought the Spider Man had eaten all the food himself. So in their great hunger and their rage and their disappointment they fell upon him and beat him and bore him to the ground, while the humped man with the lamp at his back hiding behind the trees looked on and laughed in his glee. Then the people split the Spider Mans arms to the shoulders, and his legs to the thighs, so that he had eight limbs instead of four.And the humped manthe starfairy named Fireflycame forth from behind the trees and standing over the fallen Spider Man he said, Henceforth because of your cruelty to the starpeople you will always crawl on eight legs, and you will have a fat round belly because of the water you have drunk and sometimes you will live on top of the water. But you shall always eat only flies and insects. And you will always spin downwards but never upwards, and you will often try to get back to the starcountry, but you shall always slip down again on the strand of yarn you have spun. Then Firefly flashed his light and went quickly away, opening and closing the shade of his lamp as he flitted among the trees. And to this day the Spider Man lives as the humped man of the lamp had spoken, because of the cruelty he practiced on the starfairies in the olden days.

SAMPLE STORY #2
==================================================
A duck once arrived from Portugal. There were some who said she came from Spain, but that is almost the same thing. At all events, she was called the Portuguese duck, and she laid eggs, was killed and cooked, and that was the end of her.The ducklings which crept forth from her eggs were also called Portuguese ducks, and about that there may be some question. But of all the family only one remained in the duck yard, which may be called a farmyard, since the chickens were admitted to it and the cock strutted about in a very hostile manner.He annoys me with his loud crowing, said the Portuguese duck, but still, hes a handsome bird, theres no denying that, even if he is not a duck. He ought to moderate his voice, like those little birds who are singing in the lime trees over there in our neighbors gardenbut that is an art only acquired in polite society. How sweetly they sing there it is quite a pleasure to listen to them! I call it Portuguese singing. If I only had such a little singing bird, Id be as kind and good to him as a mother, for its in my Portuguese nature.While she was speaking, one of the little singing birds came tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard. The cat was after him, but he had escaped from her with a broken wing and so came fluttering into the yard. Thats just like the cat shes a villain, said the Portuguese duck. I remember her ways when I had children of my own. How can such a creature be allowed to live and wander about upon the roofs? I dont think they allow such things in Portugal.She pitied the little singing bird, and so did all the other ducks, who were not Portuguese.Poor little creature! they said, one after another, as they came up. We cant sing, certainly but we have a sounding board, or something of the kind, within us, though we dont talk about it.But I can talk, said the Portuguese duck. Ill do something for the little fellow its my duty. So she stepped into the watering trough and beat her wings upon the water so strongly that the little bird was nearly drowned. But the duck meant it kindly. That is a good deed, she said I hope the others will take example from it.Tweet, tweet! said the little bird. One of his wings was broken and he found it difficult to shake himself, but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, so he said, You are very kindhearted, madam. But he did not wish for a second bath.I have never thought about my heart, replied the Portuguese duck but I know that I love all my fellow creatures, except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my ducklings. But pray make yourself at home it is easy to make oneself comfortable. I myself am from a foreign country, as you may see by my bearing and my feathery dress. My husband is a native of these parts hes not of my race, but I am not proud on that account. If any one here can understand you, I may say positively that I am that person.Shes quite full of portulak, said a little common duck, who was witty. All the common ducks considered the word portulak a good joke, for it sounded like Portugal. They nudged each other and said, Quack! that was witty!Then the other ducks began to notice the newcomer. The Portuguese has certainly a great flow of language, they said to the little bird. For our part, we dont care to fill our beaks with such long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much. If we dont do anything else, we can walk about with you everywhere that is the best we can do.You have a lovely voice, said one of the eldest ducks it must be a great satisfaction to you to be able to give as much pleasure as you do. I am certainly no judge of your singing, so I keep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense as others do.Dont plague him so, interrupted the Portuguese duck he requires rest and nursing. My little singing bird, do you wish me to prepare another bath for you?Oh, no! no! pray let me be dry, implored the little bird.The water cure is the only remedy for me when I am not well, said the Portuguese. Amusement, too, is very beneficial. The fowls from the neighborhood will soon be here to pay you a visit. There are two CochinChinese among them they wear feathers on their legs and are well educated. They have been brought from a great distance, and consequently I treat them with greater respect than I do the others.Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to keep from being rude. You are a real songster, he said, and you do as much with your little voice as it is possible to do but more noise and shrillness is necessary if one wishes others to know who he is.The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing bird. His feathers had been much ruffled by his bath, so that he seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl. Hes charming, they said to each other, and began a conversation with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect.We are of the same race as yourself, they said. The ducks, even the Portuguese, are all aquatic birds, as you must have noticed. You do not know us yetvery few, even of the fowls, know us or give themselves the trouble to make our acquaintance, though we were born to occupy a higher position in society than most of them. But that does not disturb us we quietly go our way among them. Their ideas are certainly not ours, for we look at the bright side of things and only speak of what is good, although that is sometimes difficult to find where none exists. Except ourselves and the cock, there is not one in the yard who can be called talented or polite. It cannot be said even of the ducks, and we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers, for she is cunning. Then the curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischiefmaker and never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the wrong. The fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is against our principles if we have nothing good to tell, we close our beaks. The Portuguese is the only one who has had any education and with whom we can associate, but she is passionate and talks too much about Portugal.I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about, whispered one duck to another. They are always doing it, and it annoys me. We never speak to them.Now the drake came up, and he thought the little singing bird was a sparrow. Well, I dont understand the difference, he said it appears to me all the same. Hes only a plaything, and if people will have playthings, why let them, I say.Dont take any notice of what he says, whispered the Portuguese he is very well in matters of business, and with him business is first. Now I shall lie down and have a little rest. It is a duty we owe to ourselves, so that we shall be nice and fat when we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and apples.So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye. She had a very comfortable place and felt so at ease that she fell asleep. The little singing bird busied himself for some time with his broken wing, and at last he too lay down, quite close to his protectress. The sun shone warm and bright, and he found it a very good place. But the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid a visit to the duck yard solely to find food for themselves. The Chinese were the first to leave, and the other fowls soon followed them.The witty little duck said of the Portuguese that the old lady was getting to be quite a doting ducky. All the other ducks laughed at this. Doting ducky,' they whispered oh, thats too witty! Then they repeated the joke about portulak and declared it was most amusing. After that they all lay down to have a nap.They had been lying asleep for quite a while, when suddenly something was thrown into the yard for them to eat. It came down with such a bang that the whole company started up and clapped their wings. The Portuguese awoke, too, and rushed over to the other side of the yard. In doing this she trod upon the little singing bird.Tweet, he cried you trod very hard upon me, madam.Well, then, why do you lie in my way? she retorted. You must not be so touchy. I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry Tweet.'Dont be angry, said the little bird the Tweet slipped out of my beak before I knew it.The Portuguese did not listen to him, but began eating as fast as she could, and made a good meal. When she had finished she lay down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable, began to singChirp and twitter,The dewdrops glitter,In the hours of sunny springIll sing my best,Till I go to rest,With my head behind my wing.Now I want rest after my dinner, said the Portuguese. You must conform to the rules of the place while you are here. I want to sleep now.The little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it kindly. When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper. Give that to a chicken, she said, and dont be always standing in my way.Why are you angry with me? replied the little singing bird what have I done?Done! repeated the Portuguese duck your mode of expressing yourself is not very polite. I must call your attention to that fact.There was sunshine here yesterday, said the little bird, but today it is cloudy and the air is heavy.You know very little about the weather, I fancy, she retorted the day is not over yet. Dont stand there looking so stupid.But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday.Impertinent creature! exclaimed the Portuguese duck. Would you compare me with the catthat beast of prey? Theres not a drop of malicious blood in me. Ive taken your part, and now Ill teach you better manners. So saying, she made a bite at the little singingbirds head, and he fell to the ground dead. Now whatever is the meaning of this? she said. Could he not bear even such a little peck as I gave him? Then, certainly, he was not made for this world. Ive been like a mother to him, I know that, for Ive a good heart.Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck his head in and crowed with steamengine power.Youll kill me with your crowing, she cried. Its all your fault. Hes lost his life, and Im very near losing mine.Theres not much of him lying there, observed the cock.Speak of him with respect, said the Portuguese duck, for he had manners and education, and he could sing. He was affectionate and gentle, and those are as rare qualities in animals as in those who call themselves human beings.Then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead bird. Ducks have strong passions, whether they feel envy or pity. There was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity. So also did the two Chinese. We shall never again have such a singing bird among us he was almost a Chinese, they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound that all the other fowls clucked too. But the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards. We have hearts of our own, they said nobody can deny that.Hearts! repeated the Portuguese. Indeed you havealmost as tender as the ducks in Portugal.Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger, said the drake thats the most important business. If one of our toys is broken, why, we have plenty more.

SAMPLE STORY #3
==================================================
Once upon a time there lived in Hindustan two kings whose countries bordered upon each other but, as they were rivals in wealth and power, and one was a Hindu rajah and the other a Mohammedan bdshah, they were not good friends at all. In order, however, to escape continual quarrels, the rajah and the bdshah had drawn up an agreement, stamped and signed, declaring that if any of their subjects, from the least to the greatest, crossed the boundary between the two kingdoms, he might be seized and punished.One morning the bdshah and his chief wazir, or prime minister, were just about to begin, their mornings work over the affairs of the kingdom, and the bdshah had taken up a pen and was cutting it to his liking with a sharp knife, when the knife slipped and cut off the tip of his finger.Ohhe, wazir! cried the king, Ive cut the tip of my finger off !That is good hearing! said the wazir in answer.Insolent one, exclaimed the king. Do you take pleasure in the misfortunes of others, and in mine also? Take him away, my guards, and put him in the court prison until I have time to punish him as he deserves !Instantly the officers in attendance seized upon the luckless wazir, and dragged him out of the kings presence towards the narrow doorway, through which unhappy criminals were wont to be led to prison or execution.As the door opened to receive him, the wazir muttered something into his great white beard which the soldiers could not hear.What said the rascal? shouted the angry king.He says, he thanks your majesty, replied one of the gaolers. And at his words, the king stared at the closing door, in anger and amazement.He must be mad, he cried, for he is grateful, not only for the misfortunes of others, but for his own surely something has turned his head !Now the king was very fond of his old wazir, and although the court physician came and bound up his injured finger with cool and healing ointment, and soothed the pain, he could not soothe the soreness of the kings heart, nor could any of all his ministers and courtiers, who found his majesty very cross all the day long.Early next morning the king ordered his horse and declared that he would go hunting. Instantly all was bustle and preparation in stable and hail, and by the time he was ready a score of ministers and huntsmen stood ready to mount and accompany him but to their astonishment the king would have none of them. Indeed, he glared at them so fiercely that they were glad to leave him. So away and away he wandered, over field and through forest, so moody and thoughtful that many a fat buck and gaudy pheasant escaped without notice, and so careless was he whither he was going that he strayed without perceiving it over into the rajahs territory, and only discovered the fact when, suddenly, men stepped from all sides out of a thicket, and there was nothing left but surrender. Then the poor bdshah was seized and bound and taken to the rajahs prison, thinking most of the time of his wazir, who was suffering a similar fate, and wishing that, like the wazir, he could feel that there was something to give thanks for.That night the rajah held a special council to consider what should be done to his rival who had thus given himself into his hands. All the Brahmans were sent for fat priests who understood all about everything, and what days were lucky and what unlucky and, whilst all the rest of the rajahs councillors were offering him different advice until he was nearly crazy with anger and indecision, the chief Brahman was squatting in a corner figuring out sums and signs to himself with an admiring group of lesser priests around him. At last he arose, and advanced towards the throne.Well, said the rajah anxiously, what have you to advise ?A very unlucky day! exclaimed the chief l3rahman. Oh, a very unlucky day! The god Devi is full of wrath, and commands that tomorrow you must chop off this bdshahs head and offer it in to him in sacrifice.Ah, well, said the rajah, let it be done. I leave it to you to carry out the sentence. And he bowed to the priests and left the room.Before dawn great preparations were being made for a grand festival in honour of the great idol Devi. Hundreds of banners waved, hundreds of drummers drummed, hundreds of singers chanted chants, hundreds of priests, well washed and anointed, performed their sacred rites, whilst the rajah sat, nervous and ill at ease, amongst hundreds of courtiers and servants, wishing it were all well over. At last the time came for the sacrifice to be offered, and the poor bdshah was led out bound, to have his head chopped off.The chief Brahman came along with a smile on his face, and a big sword in his hand, when, suddenly, he noticed that the bdshahs finger was tied up in a bit of rag. Instantly he dropped the sword, and, with his eyes starting out of his head with excitement, pounced upon the rag and tore it off, and there he saw that the tip of his victims finger was missing. At this he got very red and angry indeed, and he led the bdshah up to where the rajah sat wondering.Behold! O rajah, he said, this sacrifice is useless, the tip of his finger is gone! A sacrifice is no sacrifice unless it is complete. And he began to weep with rage and mortification.But instead of wailing likewise, the rajah gave a sigh of relief, and answered Well, that settles the matter. If it had been anyone else I should not have minded but, somehow a king and all well, it doesnt seem quite right to sacrifice a king. And with that he jumped up and with his jewelled dagger cut the bdshahs cords, and marched with him out of the temple back to the palace.After having bathed and refreshed his guest, the rajah loaded him with gifts, and himself accompanied him with a large escort as far as the frontier between their kingdoms, where, amidst salutes and great rejoicings, they tore up the old agreement and drew up another in which each king promised welcome and safe conduct to any of the others people, from the least to the greatest, who came over the border on any errand whatever. And so they embraced, and each went his own way.When the bdshah got home that very evening he sent for his imprisoned wazir.Well, O wazir! he said, when the old man had been brought before him, what think you has been happening to me ?How can a man in prison know what is happening outside it? answered the wazir.Then the bdshah told him all his adventures. And when he had reached the end he addedI have made up my mind, as a token of gratitude for my escape, to pardon you freely, if you will tell me why you gave thanks when I cut off the tip of my finger.Sire, replied the old wazir, am I not right in thinking that it was a very lucky thing for you that you did cut off the tip of your finger, for otherwise you would certainly have lost your head. And to lose a scrap of ones finger is surely the least of the two evils.Very true, answered the king, touching his head as he spoke, as if to make quite certain that it was still there, but yet why did you likewise give thanks when I put you into prison ?I gave thanks, said the wazir, because it is good always to give thanks. And had I known that my being in prison was to prevent the god Devi claiming me instead of your majesty, as a perfect offering, I should have given greater thanks still.

SAMPLE STORY #4
==================================================
A long time ago, when the world was much younger than it is now, people told and believed a great many wonderful stories about wonderful things which neither you nor I have ever seen. They often talked about a certain Mighty Being called Jupiter, or Zeus, who was king of the sky and the earth and they said that he sat most of the time amid the clouds on the top of a very high mountain where he could look down and see everything that was going on in the earth beneath. He liked to ride on the stormclouds and hurl burning thunderbolts right and left among the trees and rocks and he was so very, very mighty that when he nodded, the earth quaked, the mountains trembled and smoked, the sky grew black, and the sun hid his face.Jupiter had two brothers, both of them terrible fellows, but not nearly so great as himself. The name of one of them was Neptune, or Poseidon, and he was the king of the sea. He had a glittering, golden palace far down in the deep seacaves where the fishes live and the red coral grows and whenever he was angry the waves would rise mountain high, and the stormwinds would howl fearfully, and the sea would try to break over the land and men called him the Shaker of the Earth.The other brother of Jupiter was a sad palefaced being, whose kingdom was underneath the earth, where the sun never shone and where there was darkness and weeping and sorrow all the time. His name was Pluto, or Aidoneus, and his country was called the Lower World, or the Land of Shadows, or Hades. Men said that whenever any one died, Pluto would send his messenger, or Shadow Leader, to carry that one down into his cheerless kingdom and for that reason they never spoke well of him, but thought of him only as the enemy of life.A great number of other Mighty Beings lived with Jupiter amid the clouds on the mountain top,so many that I can name a very few only. There was Venus, the queen of love and beauty, who was fairer by far than any woman that you or I have ever seen. There was Athena, or Minerva, the queen of the air, who gave people wisdom and taught them how to do very many useful things. There was Juno, the queen of earth and sky, who sat at the right hand of Jupiter and gave him all kinds of advice. There was Mars, the great warrior, whose delight was in the din of battle. There was Mercury, the swift messenger, who had wings on his cap and shoes, and who flew from place to place like the summer clouds when they are driven before the wind. There was Vulcan, a skillful blacksmith, who had his forge in a burning mountain and wrought many wonderful things of iron and copper and gold. And besides these, there were many others about whom you will learn by and by, and about whom men told strange and beautiful stories.They lived in glittering, golden mansions, high up among the cloudsso high indeed that the eyes of men could never see them. But they could look down and see what men were doing, and oftentimes they were said to leave their lofty homes and wander unknown across the land or over the sea.And of all these Mighty Folk, Jupiter was by far the mightiest.

SAMPLE STORY #5
==================================================
Long ago, when Glooskap was the ruler of the Indians in Eastern Canada, and when the animals all worked for him and talked like men, Wolf was one of Rabbits enemies. On the surface they seemed to be friends, but each was afraid of the other and each suspected the other of treachery. Rabbit was very faithful to his work as the forest guide who showed people the way to far places. But he was also a great trickster, and he delighted to play pranks on every one he met. He liked more than all to pester Wolf, for he had a hatred for his cruel ways, and he was always able to outwit him.It happened that Rabbit and Wolf lived close together, deep in the Canadian forest. Some distance from them, in a little house, lived a poor widow woman who had only one daughter. She was a very beautiful girl, with hair as black as the ravens wing, and with eyes like the dark of the underwater. Rabbit and Wolf each fell in love with her, and each in his own way sought her as his wife. Rabbit tried hard to win her love. When he went to her house he always dressed himself in a soft brown coat, and he put a bangle around his neck and bells upon his feet. And often he played sweetly on his flute, hoping to charm her with his music, for he was a great player upon the Indian pipe. And he tried to grow a mustache to hide his split lip but he had little success, for his whiskers would not grow thick, and he has the thin scraggy mustache of a few hairs to this day. But no matter what Rabbit did to adorn himself, the girl gave him cold looks, and old Wolf seemed to be deeper in her favour, for she liked his willowy form and his sleek and bashful ways. And poor Rabbit was sore distressed.One fine day in the springtime, Rabbit came upon the girl and her mother gathering Mayflowers among the moss. He crept close to listen to their talk. He heard the mother say, I have no stomach for little Rabbit, but Wolf pleases me well. You must marry Wolf. They tell me he is a great hunter, and if you marry him we shall never want for food.When Rabbit heard this he was very sad he determined that on no account should Wolf marry the widows daughter, and that he must use all his power to prevent it. That night he went alone to the girls house. He spoke sneeringly of Wolf, saying with a bitter frown, Wolf is no hunter he never catches any game because he is lazy and has no brains I always have to feed him to keep him from starving he is but a beast of burden I always ride upon his back when I go to a far country, for he is good for nothing else.The girls mother wondered greatly, and she was very startled by this news, for she did not want her daughter to marry a goodfornothing but she was not sure that Rabbit spoke the truth, for she had heard that sometimes he told great lies. So she said, If you will ride Wolf over here I will believe you, and he shall not marry my daughter, and you shall marry her yourself. And Rabbit went home well pleased and sure of a happy ending to his trick.The next day Rabbit purposely met Wolf in the forest, and he said, Let us go together to see the widows daughter. And Wolf was glad to go. They had not gone far when Rabbit began to cry. Then he lay down on the ground, and rolled and moaned and rubbed his belly as if in great distress. I have a sharp pain in my belly, he sobbed, I cannot walk any farther. If I walk I shall surely die, and I cannot go on unless you carry me on your back.Wolf willingly agreed, for he wanted to see the beautiful girl, and he was very sorry for poor Rabbit in his pain and Rabbit, laughing to himself, climbed on Wolfs back. Wolf ran along, not feeling the load, for Rabbit was very light. They had not gone far when Rabbit cried again and said, I cannot ride without a saddle, for your bare back hurts me and gives me blisters. So they borrowed a little saddle from a field by the way and put it on Wolfs back. Soon Rabbit said, This is fine fun let us play that you are a horse and that I am a great rider. I should like to put a little bridle on you, and to wear spurs on my feet and to carry a whip.Wolf trotting along like a little horse, and Rabbit laughing to himself, sitting in the saddle. Illustration by Marcia Lane Foster, published in Canadian Wonder Tales by Cyrus MacMillan 1922, John LaneAnd Wolf, wishing to please Rabbit to make him forget his pain, gladly agreed. So they borrowed a little bridle and spurs and a whip from another field near by, and did as Rabbit asked, and together they went to the girls home, Wolf trotting along like a little horse, and Rabbit laughing to himself, sitting in the saddle, with his spurs and his whip, holding the bridle reins. When they drew near the house, Rabbit made a great noise so that the mother and her daughter might look out to see where the shouting came from. He called loudly, Whoa, Whoa. And the girl and her mother opened the door and looked out at them in wonder. Then as they were looking on, Rabbit, chuckling to himself, struck Wolf a stinging blow with his whip, and stuck his spurs deep into Wolfs sides and called him loudly a lazy beast. Wolf jumped and plunged and kicked because of the prick of the spurs and the sting of the whip he was very cross, but he said nothing.Some distance away, Rabbit tied Wolf to a tree, saying, Stay here and I will send the girl to you. Then he went to the house, and he said to the woman, Now you will believe that Wolf is a beast of burden, for I have ridden here on his back. And the woman believed him. She told him to give Wolf some corn or grass. But Rabbit said, He doesnt eat corn or grass he eats only fresh meat, for he knew well that Wolf would be quite contented if he got a good meal of meat. Then she gave him some fresh meat, which he brought to Wolf. And Wolf was happy, and his anger disappeared, and he forgot the pain of the spurs and the whip, and he thought it was fine fun to get a good meal so easily.The woman promised that Rabbit should marry her daughter, and when night fell Rabbit went home well pleased, leaving Wolf still tied to the tree. It was so dark that Wolf did not see him leaving the house, and for a long time he thought he was still inside, and he waited long in the starlight. At last he grew tired waiting, for he was hungry and he was cold standing still in the chill night air of early spring. He cut with his teeth the bridle rein that tied him to the tree, and then he went to the womans house. But the woman would not let him in. She told him to go away, that she never wished to see him again, and she called him a lazy beast of burden. He went home in great anger, for he knew now that he had been tricked, and he swore that he would have vengeance on Rabbit.The next day Rabbit learned from the woman that she had spurned Wolf from her door, and he knew that Wolf realized he had been deceived. He was somewhat frightened, for he dreaded Wolfs vengeance, and for several days he hid among the trees. Then hunger drove him out and he went forth to look for food. One evening he entered a garden in search of cabbage, and he was busy robbing it, when the people who owned the garden spied him. And they said, Here is the thief who has been stealing our vegetables. We will catch him and teach him a lesson.Before Rabbit knew it, they were upon him, for he was eating heartily, he was so hungry, and they caught him and bound him fast to a tree and went to get scalding water to pour upon his back to teach him not to rob their garden again. But while they were away Wolf came along. He, too, was very hungry, for he had eaten no meal for many days, but he was glad when he saw Rabbit, for now he thought he would have his revenge. Rabbit saw him at a distance, and he resolved to try another trick on him, and to hail him as if he thought he was still his friend. And he cried out to him, Help me, Wolf! Help me! The people here asked me to eat up a nice little lamb, and when I refused to do it, they tied me up to this tree, and they have gone to bring the lamb to me.Wolf was too hungry to be cautious, and he forgot all about Rabbits tricks, for spring lamb was his favorite food. And he said, I will eat up the little lamb, and he smacked his lips as he spoke, and thought of the nice tender meal he would have. Then Rabbit said, Untie me and take my place, for the people will soon be here with the lamb. So Wolf untied him, and Rabbit in turn bound Wolf fast to the tree, and laughing to himself because he had again outwitted stupid Wolf, he ran rapidly away.Far off he hid behind the trees to see what would happen. Soon the people came back, carrying the pots of scalding water. Wolf saw them coming, and he was in high spirits, for he thought the lamb he was to eat was in one of the pots. It was moonlight, and in the shadow of the great tree the people could not see very clearly, and they thought Wolf was Rabbit, still bound fast where they had left him. So they poured the scalding water on his back and kicked him and knocked him on the head with a big stick, and they said, Now, thief, we have taught you how dangerous it is to rob gardens in the spring moonlight. Wolf howled with pain, for his back was blistered and his head was sore, and Rabbit heard him, and he sat on a log and shook with laughter because of the success of his prank.Then the people untied Wolf and let him go. He went away wearily among the trees. And he again swore vengeance on Rabbit, and he resolved to kill him as soon as he set eyes upon him, for he knew he had been tricked a second time. For several days he searched for his enemy. At last, one night of bright moonlight, he came upon Rabbit sitting in a patch of Indian tobacco plants, eating his fill and contentedly chewing the tobacco leaves. Rabbits mouth was full of tobacco, but he laughed loudly when he saw Wolfs back bound in bandages because of the blisters, and his sore head tied up in a cloth. But when he saw Wolfs angry eyes, he was frightened, and he ran away into the woods. The moon was shining in the forest, and Wolf could catch a glimpse now and then of his brown coat among the trees, and he chased him for a long time.Rabbit tried all his tricks to shake him from his tracks, but without avail. At last, when Rabbit was almost worn out, he took refuge in a hollow tree, into which he slipped through a small hole, where Wolf could not follow him. And Wolf said, Now I have him in my power. I will kill him but first I must go home to get my axe to cut down the tree and chop off his head. Then he looked around for some one to keep watch over the tree while he was gone, so that Rabbit could not escape. At last he saw Owl sitting quietly on a branch near. He called to him and said, Watch by this hole until I get back, and do not let Rabbit get away. So Owl came down and sat by the hole and promised to keep guard over the prisoner, and Wolf went away to look for his axe.But Rabbit was not caught yet he had another trick left. After Wolf had gone away, he called to Owl sitting by the hole, and said, Owl, come and see what a nice little room I have here in the tree. But Owl replied, It is too dark, I cannot see. Then Rabbit said, Open your eyes wide and put your face close to the hole, for I have a light here and you can see easily. Owl did as he was told, for he was a curious fellow. Rabbit had a great mouthful of tobacco juice from the Indian tobacco leaves he had been chewing, and when Owl put his face close to the hole he squirted the juice into Owls eyes. Owl screamed loudly, for his eyes were smarting and he was blinded by the juice he ran around the tree and stamped and shrieked and rubbed his eyes, trying to relieve them of their pain. And while he was about it, Rabbit slipped out of the hole and ran away, and Owl did not know he was gone.Soon Wolf came back, carrying his big sharp axe. And he said, Now I shall kill him at last. And Owl was afraid to tell him about his sore eyes they were still open wide, and he could not close them. At once Wolf chopped down the hollow tree. Then he split it open from end to end. But there was no sign of Rabbit. Wolf then thought Owl had tricked him, and that he had helped Rabbit to escape. But Owl said he had not. He sat with his eyes wide open, staring stupidly and moaning and making strange noises because of his pain. Wolf thought he was laughing at him and taunting him, for he did not know the meaning of Owls strange cries, and in his rage he fell to beating him over the head with his axehandle until poor Owls head was swollen to a great size. And Owl cried, Hoot, Hoot, Hoot, and his eyes stared from his swollen head even larger than before.Then Wolf went on his way, resolved to keep away from Rabbit. And since that time Owl has cried Hoot, Hoot, Hoot at night, for he still remembers his pain and his head is still swollen and bigger than that of other birds because of the beating Wolf gave him with his axehandle and his eyes are still large and they stare stupidly, and he cannot look at the light, and he is blind in the daylight because of the tobacco juice Rabbit squirted into his eyes. And since that night Rabbit and Wolf have avoided each other, and they have not lived in the same place, and they have never since been friends.
